# Transaction Labeller Project
As a budget conscious Data Scientist, I like to analyze my transactions by category to better understand where all my money is going. For several months, I hand labelled my transactions. I decided it was time to let a machine do the work.

The goal of this project is to use the description of each transaction to predict which 'Category' I should assign it to. This is a text classification task which falls into the realm of **Supervised ML**. This is a quick pass at the task with some ideas for improving the model going forward.

 See `NBs/TransactionLabeller.ipynb` for implementation.
